This is a description of the Audio::Xmpcr module.

It provides access to control the XM Satellite Radio 'PCR' device.
The PCR is a small, user-interface-less box that tunes into XM Satellite
Radio.  Control is performed via a USB port, and (on linux) the usb-serial
module. Serial support in perl is provided by Device::SerialPort.

For technical reasons, and because the box is a shared hardware resource,
a daemon is provided. Depending on your needs, it may be preferable
to communicate with the PCR via the daemon. See the pod documentation
for more information.


To build it, make sure you have Device::SerialPort loaded. 
Unpack the module, and type :

	perl Makefile.PL
	make install

that's it.


To start the daemon, just run the command 'xmpcrd'. If you pass the
'-d' argument, debugging information will be generated. (in particular,
it just prints the client commands as they are executed.) It takes a
minute or so to come up when 'power on' is executed, since it has to scan 
all of the channels.

The daemon recognizes when the web-interface connects, and tries to
start the darkice program (for audio brodcast to icecast). See
http://www.icecast.org for more info. If all you want is web-based control
(and no audio broadcasting), you can disable darkice by editing the
daemon's source (there's a configuration section at the top).

Likewise, to use the web interface, copy the web/.cgi file to a convenient
place in your web directory, and edit the configuration section at the
top of the .cgi to point to the location of the templates.

Included are two applications:
	* a stream ripper that builds wav files named appropriately, and
	* a web interface for controlling the pcr.

See the pod documentation in Xmpcr.pm for:
	* a more detailed description of the module
  * A copyright notice.
